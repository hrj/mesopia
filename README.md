Preserve your [mesopic vision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopic_vision).
For Linux users; tested on Ubuntu 12.04. Ubuntu 12.10 has a [bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/compiz-plugins-main/+bug/1093565) due to which compiz color filters don't work.

*Update*: Because of the Ubuntu bug, I now use an alternate method. I use a [simple shell script](https://gist.github.com/hrj/6561271) that achieves the same effect.

# About
mesopia is a collection of Compiz color filters to help those who work in low-light environments.

# Installation
Download one of the `.arb` files and add the downloaded file's location into the Compiz Config -> Color Filters dialog.
Make sure that the Color Filters plugin is enabled.
Then press the shortcut key to start the Color Filter. By default it is set to `Super + d` on Ubuntu.
